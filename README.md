# MNSIT-with-MLP-Vanilla-Pytorch

MLP Network was used for MNSIT DATA. I could get a accuracy of 97.82% without any regularization or hyperparameters tuning and model was trainined using 5 epochs.As MNSIT is simple dataset, Basic MLP could easily attain 98% accuracy. This was performed in Pytorch, GPU-NVIDIA GEFORC GTX 2050 Ti
